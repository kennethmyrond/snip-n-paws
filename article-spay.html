            What is Spay or Neuter

            <p>
                Veterinarians and pet owners often use the term “fixing” to describe both spaying and neutering, as both procedures result in sterilization, preventing unwanted pregnancies.
                <br><br>
                But why are there two separate terms? It comes down to gender. Both male and female pets, including cats and dogs, can be “fixed,” but neutering refers specifically to males, while spaying is for females. Although both procedures achieve sterilization, the methods involved are quite different.
                <br><br>
                When a male animal is neutered, the veterinarian removes his testicles, which means he can no longer impregnate a female. Generally, this procedure also leads to a decrease in mating interest. For female animals, the veterinarian removes the uterus and ovaries of the cat, dog, or other animal, effectively preventing unwanted pregnancies.

                <ul>
                    <li>Always check their surgical sites, of swelling, discharge, bleeding, or any other issues. If you observe any troubling symptoms, don’t hesitate to reach out to your veterinarian. Typically, spay/neuter skin incisions heal completely within 10 to 14 days, which is also when stitches or staples, if used, should be removed.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Elizabethan collars, often called "cones" or E-collars, play a crucial role in preventing your pet from licking, chewing, or scratching their surgical site. If your veterinarian suggests using a cone after surgery, it's important to follow their advice to prevent any potentially serious complications.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>It's essential to enforce strict activity restrictions after spay and neuter surgeries. Engaging in activities such as running, jumping, or playing can lead to complications like stitch failure, bleeding, pain, and other post-surgical issues. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines to limit your pet's activity for 10 to 14 days after the procedure.</li>
